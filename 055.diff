- Notice that the initial players are minted to `footiumClub.ownerOf(tokenId)`, while the `InitialPlayerMinted` event uses `to`. Notice that these can actually be different, because after `footiumClub.safeMint(to, tokenId);`, the club NFT can be transferred in `onERC721Received`. The event is therefore wrong, and can lead to errors with off chain processing.
