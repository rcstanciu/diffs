- The contract is upgradable, which means that `initialize` function should be called and used as a constructor and prior to this call the contract is available and functional and everybody can call it's functions. Which is a problem when there are payment functions. Those functions never check whether the contract has already been initialised. Another problem here is that [`setPaymentReceiverAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumGeneralPaymentContract.sol#L52)  never check if the provided argument is a valid address (!= address(0)), which is best practice and is easily implemented.
