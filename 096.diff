- The `whenNotPaused` modifier suggests only the owner should be able to call the function when the contract is paused. However, there's no explicit access control check within the function itself to enforce this restriction.

?                        +
- The function `mintPlayer` is marked with the `whenNotPaused` modifier, which suggests that the owner should control pausing and activating the contract. However, the function does not explicitly check the caller’s address within the function body, to ensure that only the owner can call it during a paused state. This could potentially allow anyone to call the function and mint players even when the contract is intended to be inactive.

- ## Recommendation
+ ## Recommendation
?                  +
- A possible recommendation to fix this vulnerability is to add an explicit check for the caller’s address within the function body, using the `msg.sender` variable and the owner state variable. This can provide an additional layer of security and prevent potential bypasses of the access control mechanism.
