  # Minting to Wrong Club :: Unauthorized Player Allocation

- The function relies on the external `_footiumClub.ownerOf` function to verify club ownership before minting a player. This poses a potential security risk if that function is compromised or vulnerable to manipulation.

?                        +
- The function `mintPlayer` checks if the caller owns the club to which the player is being minted, using the external `_footiumClub.ownerOf` function. However, this function may not be reliable or secure, as it depends on another contract that may be compromised or vulnerable to manipulation. For example, if the `_footiumClub` contract has a bug or a malicious owner, the `ownerOf` function may return incorrect or inconsistent values, allowing an attacker to mint players to a wrong club even if they don’t own it.

- ## Recommendation
+ ## Recommendation
?                  +
- A possible recommendation to fix this vulnerability is to use a more secure and reliable way of verifying the club ownership, such as using a mapping or a set to store the club IDs and the owners, and checking the caller’s address against the stored value. This can prevent potential manipulation or compromise of the external contract, and ensure that only the legitimate owners can mint players to their clubs.
