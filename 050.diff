- # FootiumClub does not implement ERC2981 (a medium reported in the last audit but not fixed)
+ # FootiumClub does not implement ERC2981
  
  ## Summary
- Before everything else the credit for this finding goes to 0x52 and 0xRobocop. I gave a link to the issue in the **Code Snippet** section.
+ Footium players implement royalties while clubs do not, so marketplaces that do respect the EIP-2981 will not be paying royalties for the club NFTs which deprives developers from yield.
  
  ## Vulnerability Detail
- The issue is well described by the above mentioned auditors. It was confirmed that clubs should implement ERC2981 Royalties which should go back to the developers upon selling a club. However `FootiumClub` still does not inherit `ERC2891Upgradeable`.

  ## Impact
  Loss of yield for Footium developers
  
  ## Code Snippet
- This is the relevant issue, for which it was confirmed clubs should implement the EIP2981 standard so that on club sale royalties will be paid back to the protocol developers, yet this has not been fixed.
